# Lumina TODO

- Precise diagnostic ranges for type holes in generics (requires structured type AST).
- Function overloading for math operations (abs/absf → abs).
- Full type parameter resolution in ADT specialization (currently allows unresolved params in nested contexts).
- Dead code elimination for unused monomorphic variants.
